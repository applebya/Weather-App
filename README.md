# Weather App
Technical challenge for Brili in AngularJS and C3js. I was later hired to build out their analytics module, which was a whole lot of fun!

# Run
1. `npm install`
2. Run some kind of server for the $http requests, for example: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`
3. Check the weather forecast while you sip on a cold one!
